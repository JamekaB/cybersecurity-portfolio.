Jameka Beasley
From Atlanta, Ga United States 
I'm currently inrolled in a cybersecurity classes throgh Coursera. I'm interested in IT because I love to learn new things involving technology and challenge my self. IT give me opportunity to learn new things as the IT world evolves. I'm going to become a Cybersecurity Analyst in the IT field because that is one of the position that spark my interest.
The satisfaction of knowing that I am helping to prevent cyber crimes and safeguarding valuable data is what drives my interest in IT. 
  Once i finish the cybersecurity course i'm going to become a cyber security analyst for a good company, Then i'm going to work at that company at 2-3 years.Then im going to reach for a job position in Govtech.First i will find a role that will actually sponsor me to get a US government security clearance.
Therefore i will make sure i build a great Linkedin profile and a great resume so i can start applying for a job in the GovTech industry, after i land my Govtech job i'm going to start on getting my CompTIA CySA+/ Ethical Hacker Certification.
   I'm proud of going foward with submitting my resumes for this cybersecurity program because  I was a little worried because I had to adjust my focus and priorities due to my medical issues, appointments scheduling, work, school and making sufficient income to my pay bills on time and me being chosen 
Iâ€™m proud of my work ethic. Also my everyday proactive involvement I put in to get this far with being close to getting accepted into the program knowing that I was one of many applicants that applied, which has built my self esteem & confidence into maintaining the pace that is showing solidifies results.
